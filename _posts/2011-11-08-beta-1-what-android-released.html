Android application has just gone Beta!<br /><br />To mark this momentous occasion (remember developing in Java is completely new to me!), I have given the app it's very own page on this here blog.&nbsp; The page has the reasons for development, links to the change log, source code and (more importantly) the apk file itself.<br /><br />Use the What The Android link in the links bar above or <a href="http://chall32.blogspot.com/p/what-for-android.html">click here</a> to have a look at the What The Android page.<br /><br />If you fancy being an early adopter / beta tester, then feel free.&nbsp; Please post any feedback in comments below.<br /><br />- Chris<br />&nbsp;<div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
