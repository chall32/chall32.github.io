&nbsp;Follows is simple one liner list detailing at a very high level what each VMware component brings to the table. &nbsp;Click the application names to find out more.<br /><br />.....oh and I promise to to use the fluffy word (cloud) as little as possible....<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vsphere/overview.html" target="_blank">vSphere</a></b> - As discussed, your ESXi and vCenter instances.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloud-network-security/overview.html" target="_blank"><b>vCNS Manager</b></a> - Used to manage your software defined networking and security solutions (including&nbsp;virtual firewall, VPN, load balancing and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/solutions/datacenter/vxlan.html" target="_blank">VXLAN</a> implementations).<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-director/overview.html" target="_blank">vCloud Director</a></b> - Used to create multiple virtual datacenters using multiple separate vSphere instances.<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-orchestrator/overview.html" target="_blank">vCenter Orchestrator</a></b> - Used to automate workflows (including virtual infrastructure provisioning) either within or outside of your virtual environment.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcenter-operations-management/overview.html" target="_blank"><b>vCenter Operations Manager</b></a> - Used to proactively manage, monitor and drive efficiency into your vSphere and / or vCloud infrastructure.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/configuration-manager/index.html" target="_blank"><b>vCenter Configuration Manager</b></a> - Used to ensure configuration and compliance management of both your virtual and physical infrastructure.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcenter-infrastructure-navigator" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">vCenter Infrastructure Navigator</a>&nbsp;- Used to&nbsp;discover application services, visualize relationships and map dependencies of applications on your virtual infrastructure<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/it-business-management/vcenter-chargeback/overview.html" target="_blank">vCenter Chargeback Manager</a></b> - Used to track and provide costings of virtual solutions hosted on shared physical infrastructure.<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/application-platform/vfabric-rabbitmq.html" target="_blank">AMQP (Rabbit MQ)</a></b> - Used to provide message queueing and handling allowing your virtual infrastructure to interface with a wide range of other software products.<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/application-platform/vfabric-application-director/overview.html" target="_blank">vFabric Application Director</a> </b>- Used to deploy applications in a repeatable, supportable and standards compliant manner within your virtual infrastructure.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloud-automation-center/overview.html" target="_blank"><b>vCloud Automation Center</b></a> - Used to rapidly deploy services (potentially consisting of several individual applications). Also provides client self service portal to allow clients to deploy services on their own.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloudconnector/" target="_blank"><b>vCloud Connector</b></a> - Used to connect your vCloud Director managed virtual datacenters together for &nbsp;datacenter extension, content sync, unified management and / or datacenter migration.<br /><br /><b><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/site-recovery-manager/" target="_blank">Site Recovery Manager</a></b> - Used for automated disaster recovery of your virtual infrastructure.<br /><br /><b>ISV Backup Application</b> - Independent Software Vendor backup application, typically leveraging <a href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/solutions/datacenter/business-continuity/data-protection.html" target="_blank">vSphere Data Protection (VDP)</a><br /><br />So there you have it, and now you know what each application is and what it can be used for in your virtual datacenter, private and/or public clouds. &nbsp;Just think about it for a moment:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: red; font-size: large;"><b>Your VMware admin just became your most valuable asset.</b>&nbsp;</span></div><br />Why? &nbsp;Here's why. With the above, your VMware administrator can:<br /><br /><ol><li>Deploy configure and create fully resilient hardware using <a href="http://chall32.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/cisco-ucs-what-the.html">Cisco UCS</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Create your new virtual infrastructure using vSphere</li><li>Connect your virtual infrastructure using <a href="http://chall32.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/adding-vlans-to-cisco-nexus-1000v.html">Cisco Nexus 1000v</a> switching</li><li>Create your new virtual datacenter using vCloud Director</li><li>Firewall and gateway your virtual infrastructure and datacenter using VCNS Manager</li><li>Create separate client use and management access VPNs using VCNS Manager</li><li>Rapidly deploy industry supportable applications and virtual machines into your&nbsp;virtual infrastructure and datacenter&nbsp;using vFabric Application Director and verify the deployment using&nbsp;vCenter Configuration Manager</li><li>Rapidly deploy industry supportable services (consisting of multiple applications based on multiple virtual machines) into your&nbsp;virtual infrastructure and datacenter using vCloud Automation Center and verify the deployment using&nbsp;vCenter Configuration Manager</li><li>Orchestrate repeatable maintenance / deployment / day to day operations using vCenter Orchestrator</li><li>Monitor, proactively manage and drive efficiency in your&nbsp;virtual infrastructure and datacenter using&nbsp;vCenter Operations Manager</li><li>Map dependencies between and mitigate 'pinch points' in your virtual infrastructure and datacenter using vCenter Infrastructure Navigator</li><li>Configure&nbsp;vCloud Automation Center to allow your trusted clients to create their own infrastructure</li><li>Connect, deploy and migrate to other&nbsp;virtual infrastructure and datacenters using vCloud Connector</li><li>Provide automated billing information to your clients using vCenter Chargeback Manager</li><li>Ensure rapid Disaster Recovery planning and execution using Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Data Protection</li></ol><br />Plus if there is enough time, it's just possible your VMware administrator could sweep the datacenter floor too... if there is enough time.... ....virtually of course....<br /><br />- Chris<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
