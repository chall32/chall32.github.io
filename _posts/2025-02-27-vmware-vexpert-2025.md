I'm still on *cloud* nine ([boom boom!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtxbM7-jAD0){:target="_blank"}) after receiving the news that I've been selected as a VMware vExpert for the sixth year in a row. This prestigious award is given annually by VMware to recognise individuals who have made significant contributions to the virtualisation community through their blog posts, articles, and other forms of content creation.

As someone who's passionate about virtualisation and cloud computing, it's an incredible honour to be recognised among such a talented group of professionals. Over the past six years, I've had the privilege of sharing my knowledge and experiences with others through this blog, as well as speaking at industry events and participating in online forums. It's been an amazing journey so far, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue making a positive impact on the community.

One of the things that makes me most proud is seeing how my content has helped others learn and grow in their own virtualisation journeys. Whether it's through tutorials, troubleshooting tips, or simply sharing best practices, I've been humbled by the feedback and encouragement from readers like you. Your support means the world to me, and I'm excited to continue creating valuable resources that will help take your Nutanix and VMware skills to the next level.

As a vExpert, I'll have access to exclusive benefits, including early access to new VMware products and features, as well as opportunities to collaborate with other experts in the field. This is going to be an incredible year for virtualisation, with many exciting developments on the horizon – and I'm thrilled to be at the forefront of it all.

So here's to another amazing year ahead! Thank you again to everyone who has supported me along this journey. If you're new to my blog or just looking for some inspiration, please don't hesitate to reach out and share your own virtualisation stories. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible with multicloud computing – together, we can achieve great things!
