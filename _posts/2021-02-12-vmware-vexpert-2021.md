Yup, thats right... Again!

I've again been appraised, approved and selected to be a VMware vExpert for the second year running!

Reading through the [vExpert 2021 Award Announcement](https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2021/02/11/vexpert-2021-award-announcement/):

All of the new and returning vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others. Contributing is not always blogging or Twitter as there are many VMUG leaders, public speakers, book authors, script writers, VCDX, VMTN community moderators and internal champions among this group.

We are on-boarding just under 2,100 vExperts from 40+ countries.

Nice!

Check me out in the [vExpert Directory](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/5800)
