RIP." /></a></div>Bye Bye What the.....? Blog Mark II, hello Mark III.<br /><br />I'm sure you'll agree, Mark III is a significant improvement over its predecessor in ease of use, navigation and hopefully page loading time.<br /><br />I've tried to make the transition as painless as possible, and I like to think that all is well, but as with any such change its likely that some niggles still remain.&nbsp; With a bit of luck we'll be fully shipshape in no time.<br /><br />In the meantime, have fun and enjoy!<br /><br />- Chris<div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
