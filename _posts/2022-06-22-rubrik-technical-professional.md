Yup, that's right, yours truly is now a Rubrik Technical Professional!

The Rubrik Technical Professional (RTP) accreditation training prepares technical pre-sales professionals to demonstrate their ability to build innovative data management solutions across Rubrik Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) and Polaris platforms both on-premises and in the cloud.

Isn't Rubrik a backup product?<br>
Historically yes, the Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) product is an on premisses and cloud backup and recovery platform, however the Rubrik product suite and hence the RTP qualification has grown to include the Rubrik Polaris platform.

Rubrik Polaris includes the following:

#### Radar
Rubrik Polaris Radar helps increase resiliency against ransomware by making it faster and easier to recover from an attack. Radar also helps to recover faster by providing a simple, intuitive user interface that allows for quick restores to the most recent clean state with minimum downtime. It increases intelligence by using machine learning to actively monitor and generate alerts for anomalous behaviour, like ransomware. To accelerate the discovery of an attackâ€™s impact, Radar provides insight into how your data changed at the time of the event.

#### Sonar
As organizations adopt cloud, they grapple with massive data fragmentation, making it impossible to know where sensitive data resides. At the same time, the increasing risk of data privacy breaches and non-compliance with regulations can impose serious financial penalties. Sensitive Data Discovery is a SaaS application that discovers, classifies, and reports on sensitive data without any impact to production. By leveraging your existing Rubrik deployments, users get up and running in just a few minutes with zero additional infrastructure required.
