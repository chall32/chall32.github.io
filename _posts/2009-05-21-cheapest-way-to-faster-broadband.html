"No biggie" I thought, "I guess that's it".  But something didn't sit right, especially when you consider that:<br /><br />1. I Iive on a fairly modern housing estate and as such BT have run fibre from my local telephone exchange (some 2 to 3 miles away) up to the box in my street, leaving the last 500ish yards run in copper.<br />[I know this to be true as this reason was given to me by BT in the early days of broadband to be the <span style="font-weight: bold;">exact reason</span> as to why I couldn't get broadband!  See <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,2133329,00.htm">here</a> for the whole sorry story]<br /></span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">2. The "big push" as announced recently by the UK government to get everyone onto at least 2Mb broadband.<br /><br />3. The Virgin TV <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/video/2009/jan/02/virginmedia-internet">advert</a> - fibre optic saves the day!<br /><br />So why can I only get a 1Mb broadband connection, I'm on fibre!!! (grrr) What can I do to improve the situation?<br /><br />I've tried:<br /></span><ul><li><span style="font-family:arial;">Plugging the router into the master socket</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;">Removing the bell wire (details <a href="http://www.thinkbroadband.com/faq/sections/radsl.html#235">h</a></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><a href="http://www.thinkbroadband.com/faq/sections/radsl.html#235">ere</a>)</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;">Monitoring my signal to noise ratio whilst turning all electromagnetic noise generating devices off (lol isn't that what the individual RCB's in your consumer unit are for? turn everything else in the house off apart from the ring main your router is plugged into?!?)</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;">DGTeam firmware (more on this later)</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;">Plus a whole host of ADSL micro filter tweaks etc etc etc</span></li></ul><span style="font-family:arial;">Next step was to look closer at my ro</span><span style="font-family:arial;">uter and see what could be done there.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old Router<br /></span>As you'll probably guess, I'm a Netgear fan.  My old router was a Netgear DG834G version 1:<br /></span><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/ShXXFTL-UOI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cxUIbrmjoDU/s1600-h/dg834g.gif"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 260px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/ShXXFTL-UOI/AAAAAAAAAAc/cxUIbrmjoDU/s320/dg834g.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338409419367403746" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:78%;">DG834G - Great Router<br /></span></div><span style="font-family:arial;"><br />Pros:<br /></span><ul><li><span style="font-family:arial;"> Stable</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;"> Simple to administer</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;">It's never let me down</span></li></ul><span style="font-family:arial;">Cons:<br /></span><ul><li><span style="font-family:arial;">Doesn't do WPA2 wireless encryption</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;"> The DG834G v1 is based on the Texas Instruments AR7 chipset, which no stranger to controversy with Zen raising <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/22/zen_ar7_infineon_bt_fault/">concerns</a> over it's stability.</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;"> I purchased this sometime around September / October 2003, what advances in broadband router technology (if any) am I missing out on?</span></li></ul><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firmware</span><br />Netgear firmware is open source, and I had heard that using custom firmware additional router adjustments - "tweaks" - were available.  Could one of these tweaks help me?<br /><br />Step in <a href="http://dgteam.ilbello.com/">DGTeam</a> firmware.<br />As can be seen from the DGTeam firmware change log, they have managed to just make one or two (hundred) changes to the standard Netgear firmware making it far superior to the standard firmware.<br /><br />One of the tweaks </span><span style="font-family:arial;">included in the DGTeam firmware </span><span style="font-family:arial;">that interested me was the signal to noise (SNR) percentage adjustment.  Put simply, SNR compares the level of a desired signal (in my case the ADSL signal) to the level of background noise on the telephone line.<br /><br />My line is set to provide a 15dB signal to noise ratio.  Therefore, when handshaking with the exchange, my router will always synchronise at a speed that will ensure that there is a 15dB SNR.  It will do this at the expense of connection speed...!<br /><br />With the </span><span style="font-family:arial;">signal to noise percentage adjustment, </span><span style="font-family:arial;"> I could tweak this 15dB down to, say, 10dB (or lower!) which in turn would allow my router to synchronise my broadband connetion at a faster rate...!<br /><br />PROBLEM - the SNR percentage adjustment is not available on the AR7 chipset DGTeam firmware... doh!<br /></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />So what to do?<br /></span>It was clear that I was potentially in the market for a new router.<br />Budget?   Hmm nothing that would break the bank...<br />Make? Netgear<br />Model? Hmm...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step in Tim and take a bow!</span><br />I can't write this post without mentioning him.  Tim had already done the leg work on this and was (as usual) light years ahead.  As usual, Tim had put 2 and 2 together and correctly arrived at 4 whilst the rest of us were still counting 1... 2... 3...<br /><br />Tim had realised that:<br /></span><ol><li><span style="font-family:arial;">Lots of ex-BSkyB Broadband customers were selling their old Sky branded Netgear routers on ebay.</span></li><li><span style="font-family:arial;">White (not the black or grey) ex-BSkyB routers were BSkyB branded DG834G<span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>s.
