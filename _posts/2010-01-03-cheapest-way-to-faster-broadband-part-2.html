I'm not saying that they are no good, an in fact I know of several others that have seen speed increases just by fitting them, I'm just stating that here on my line it's not made any noticeable performance difference.&nbsp; Has it made my line more stable?&nbsp; Not sure.&nbsp; Line stability is very subjective and hard to quantify.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>All Tweaked Out?</b></span><br />Looking at the thinkbroadband Line Sync vs IP Profile table once again:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a alt="thinkbroadband Line Sync vs IP Profile table" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/Szpks93qaVI/AAAAAAAAAV8/04Pwk_xzu7E/s1600-h/table.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="thinkbroadband Line Sync vs IP Profile table"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/Szpks93qaVI/AAAAAAAAAV8/04Pwk_xzu7E/s400/table.PNG" /></a></div>Notice that my sync speed of somewhere between 3000Kbps and 3200Kbps is quite close to the next step up in IP Profile; 3424Kbps = 3Mbps throughput.<br /><br />In fact, I've already had (albeit fleetingly) an IP Profile of 3Mbps as posted <a href="http://chall32.blogspot.com/2009/07/3mb-barrier-smashed.html" target="_blank">here</a>, so I know that 3Mb is potentially possible on my line. <br /><br />So, being that some tweaking has already gained me a hefty speed increase, is it possible to squeeze that last drop out of the line to get even more speed?<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Going For More - The Warm Up</b></span><br />We need a very quick recap here just so that what follows is not total gobbledygook.<br /><blockquote><i><b>Signal to Noise Ratio</b></i><br /><i>Put simply, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) compares the level of a desired signal (in my case the ADSL signal) to the level of background noise on the telephone line.&nbsp; My line is set at the exchange to provide a 15dB signal to noise ratio.&nbsp; Therefore, when handshaking with the exchange, my router will always synchronise at a speed that will ensure that there is a 15dB SNR.&nbsp; <br /><br /><u>This is achieved at the expense of connection speed.</u></i><br /><br /><i>However with a SNR adjustment at the router end, It is possible to override the exchange's preferred SNR which in turn allows the router to synchronise the broadband connection at a faster rate, gaining a higher IP Profile and higher throughput.</i></blockquote>The down side is that as the connection speed increases the line stability decreases.&nbsp; The art is in trading stability for speed - achieving a higher throughput whilst keeping the line stable.<br /><br />The action of overriding the exchange preferred SNR achievable on <u>ANY ADSL line</u>.&nbsp; There really are no smoke and mirrors here, my ADSL line is the same as anyone else's.<br /><br />First off, lets look at my existing stats:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a alt="3264Kbps for a SNR of 8.8dB (taken on a pretty good day!)" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/ShXxiZjuJ9I/AAAAAAAAAA0/K4ICIwlMN8s/s1600/stats.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="3264Kbps for a SNR of 8.8dB (taken on a pretty good day!)"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/ShXxiZjuJ9I/AAAAAAAAAA0/K4ICIwlMN8s/s320/stats.png" /></a></div>3264Kbps for a SNR of 8.8dB (taken on a pretty good day!)<br /><br />The 'million dollar question' is how low can the SNR go?&nbsp; What's the lowest SNR (and hence the highest Sync speed) I can get?<br /><br />Looking at <a href="http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/maxdsl2.htm" target="_blank">Kitz's forum FAQ</a> (SNR /SNR Margin section) they believe that a SNR of 3dB is probably as low as you can go.&nbsp; In the interests of stability I think I'll double that and go for a SNR of 6dB. <br /><br />But how can I tweak my SNR down further?&nbsp; I'm already at 1% on my SNR Slider in the <a href="http://dgteam.ilbello.com/index.php?pid=12" target="_blank">DGTeam firmware</a> running on my router:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a alt="DGTeam SNR Percentage Slider" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/ShXuitegTFI/AAAAAAAAAAs/TJV6lq4r9VY/s1600/advanced.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="DGTeam SNR Percentage Slider"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/ShXuitegTFI/AAAAAAAAAAs/TJV6lq4r9VY/s320/advanced.png" /></a></div>Well, it just so happens that some additional tweaking is possible.&nbsp; LOL You guessed it!<br /><br />Whilst scouting around trying to find out how to drop my SNR further, I found this thread over at Kitz's forums - <a href="http://forum.kitz.co.uk/index.php/topic,5195.0.html" target="_blank">Tweaking Broadcom based routers</a>.&nbsp; It turns out that the DGTeam firmware doesn't drive down the SNR as hard as hoped or first thought.<br /><br />From the forum:<br /><blockquote style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Broadcom-based routers can be tweaked to change the target noise margin set in the exchange, using the adslctl command in telnet. With Netgear routers, the DGTeam firmware makes it possible to perform the same tweak in the web interface. But in either case the tweak is limited to about - 5.5 dB in the downward direction, so if your target noise margin has been increased to 15 dB you won't be able to get it down to less than about 9.5 dB using documented methods. Note that, without the DGTeam firmware, this tweak doesn't survive a re-boot. So if you power down the router or re-boot you'll have to enter the command again.<br /><br />The normal form of the adslctl noise margin tweak command is<br /><br /><i>adslctl configure --snr N</i></blockquote><i>Roseway - Kitz forums</i>.<br /><br />Values for N are as follows:<br /><br /><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="width: 300px;"><tbody><tr><td><b>Change you want in SNR</b></td><td><b>Value for N</b> </td></tr><tr><td>No change/reset to default value  </td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 1.5 dB</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 3 dB</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 4.5 dB</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 6 dB</td><td>65550*</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 7.5 dB</td><td>65525*</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 9 dB</td><td>65500*</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 10.5 dB</td><td>65475*</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 12 dB</td><td>65450*</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 13.5 dB</td><td>65425*</td></tr><tr><td>Lower by 15 dB</td><td>65400*</td></tr></tbody></table><br />* The command does not accept negative numbers.&nbsp; However the command can be tricked into accepting negative numbers by entering high positive numbers.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Going for More - Making It Happen</b></span><br />As mentioned earlier, it looks like the target SNR set by the exchange on my line is 15dB.<br />I want to override this and sync at a SNR of 6dB.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">15 - 6 = 9dB</div><br />Therefore I need to issue this command to my router:<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">adslctl configure --snr 65500</span></div><br />In for a penny, in for a pound, I'm going to go for a drop of 9.5dB (setting my SNR at 5.5dB), so that'll be N = 65480.<br /><br />Here is how to do it:<br /><ol><li>Enable debug via the web interface by browsing to <a href="http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?todo=debug" target="_blank">http://192.168.0.1/setup.cgi?todo=debug</a> [remember to change the IP address of you are not using 192.168.0.1 for your router]<br /></li><li>Open a command prompt</li><li>Enter the following command: <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">telnet 192.168.0.1</span></li><li>Login using your usual router username (admin) and password</li><li>Issue the command <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">adslctl configure --snr N</span> (in my case: <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">adslctl configure --snr 65480</span>)</li><li>Connect to router using browser as normal and check your connections statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>Here are mine:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a alt="Spot on!
