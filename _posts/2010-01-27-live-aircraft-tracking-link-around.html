Heading back to Gatwick?&nbsp; Heathrow?&nbsp; Stansted?&nbsp; Looks like your holiday is over!"<br /><br />No?&nbsp; Just me then.... ahem.....<br /><br />How about "I wonder what time uncle Bob's flight gets in?" <br /><br />Anyway, thanks to the internet it's simple to find out what's where and where it's going.&nbsp; Follows is a link-around of online flight tracking websites.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://www.radarvirtuel.com/" target="_blank">radarvirtuel</a> - provides tracking and data for pretty much the whole of Europe.&nbsp; Used for screenshot above.&nbsp; Top Site!<br /><br /><a href="http://casper.frontier.nl/" target="_blank">casper</a> - tracks air traffic around and in or out of Schiphol airport<br /><br /><a href="http://gmapsflighttracker.com/" target="_blank">gmapsflighttracker</a> - Fight data for eight major US airports<br /><br /><a href="http://radar.zhaw.ch/radar.html" target="_blank">radar.zhaw</a> - data on flights around Zurich airport<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flightradar24.com/" target="_blank">flightradar24</a> - details on flights around central and northern Europe<br /><br /><a href="http://www.aeroseek.com/webtrax/airnav.html" target="_blank">aeroseek</a> - search for and track a single or random flight to track.&nbsp; (Top site to track uncle Bob!)<br /><br />Getting as close as possible realtime flight data right to your desktop - done.<br /><br />Now all you need to decide is how long to leave it until you need to jump in the car to pick uncle Bob up from the airport....<br /><br />PS - If you know of any other sites, let me know.<br /><br />- Chris<div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
