The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.</blockquote>This is perhaps the easiest area to find free services. Free examples include:<br /><ul><li>Email = Gmail / Hotmail / Yahoo mail</li><li>Blogging = Blogger / Wordpress.com / Twitter</li><li>Image Hosting = flikr / Picasa / Imgur</li><li>Social Networking = facebook / Myspace</li></ul><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.</blockquote>A little harder to find.&nbsp; Free examples include:<br /><ul><li>Application hosting = Google apps </li><li>Build your own application&nbsp; = Yahoo pipes </li><li>ISPs (Some ISPs allow you run your own apps on their platforms as part of your internet subscription)</li><li>Predetermined application hosting = host1free.com </li></ul><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).</blockquote>Not easy to find - well for free at least!&nbsp; I couldn't find any free providers of IaaS, which kind of makes sense as I don't believe there are the alternative revenue streams available yet allow the provision of IaaS for free.<br /><br />So all in all a very quick look into the cloud.&nbsp; Minus the garbage and the jargon.&nbsp; Not all that hard to comprehend now is it?<br /><br />- Chris<div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
