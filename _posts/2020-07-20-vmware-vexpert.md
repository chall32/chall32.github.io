Yup, thats right!

After missing many, many applications, I've finally applied, been appraised, approved and selected to be a VMware vExpert!

Reading through the [vExpert 2020 Second Half Award Announcement](https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2020/07/17/vexpert-2020-second-half-award-announcement/) I am one of just 269 newly onboarded vExperts for the second half of 2020.

## Program Overview

The VMware vExpert program is VMware's global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware's marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware's roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year's (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.


Nice!
