As we open the second application period for 2025 for the Nutanix Multicloud Experts Community, it's brilliant to see how this initiative continues to grow and evolve following the successful launch of the first cohort in January.

The MCE Community continues to tackle one of the biggest challenges facing organisations today: navigating the ever-increasing complexity of multicloud environments. What started as a vision to connect cloud experts has grown into a proper community where knowledge sharing isn't just encouraged—it's essential.

## What Makes This Application Period Special

The application window opens today (1st July) and runs through to 31st August, giving professionals plenty of time to showcase their multicloud expertise. The requirements remain focused on substance over flash: you'll need your Nutanix Certified Associate (NCA) certification as a baseline, plus demonstrable experience in real-world multicloud scenarios.

What's particularly encouraging is the emphasis on active community participation. Whether you're publishing technical blogs, creating video content, or engaging in industry discussions on social platforms, the programme recognises that expertise means nothing if it's not shared.

## The Value Proposition

Beyond the obvious networking benefits, members gain access to:
- Cutting-edge resources and hands-on labs
- Direct collaboration with Nutanix CTOs and engineers  
- Community Edition licences for practical experience
- Early insights into market trends and innovations

The six-monthly registration cycle keeps the community fresh whilst ensuring members remain actively engaged rather than simply collecting another badge.

## Looking Ahead

With the multicloud landscape becoming increasingly sophisticated, initiatives like the MCE Community are more relevant than ever. The focus on peer-to-peer learning, combined with access to Nutanix's technical expertise, creates a genuine opportunity for professionals to stay ahead of the curve.

If you're working in the multicloud space and have the NCA certification (or can obtain it), it's worth considering. The community appears to have found the right balance between exclusivity and accessibility—demanding enough standards to ensure quality whilst remaining open to genuine practitioners.

As a member of the MCE Community Team helping to administer this programme, I've seen firsthand how valuable these connections become. The conversations that spark in our community channels often lead to real solutions for complex multicloud challenges—and that's exactly what we hoped to achieve when we launched.

Applications open today (1st July). More details and registration at the Nutanix events portal, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the programme.
