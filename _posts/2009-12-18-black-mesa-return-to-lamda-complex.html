XBox, Playstation, Wii, PC - I can take or leave them all, and I generally leave them.<br /><br />In the true sense of the phrase; <i>I don't play games sonny..</i><br /><br />That said, there has only really been one game that I have played and completed: Half-Life.&nbsp; I enjoyed it so much, I also completed the add-ons Opposing Force and Blue Shift.<br /><br />Mrs H even bought me Half-Life 2 when it came out - I never finished it.<br /><br />Ten years on (yea I know - 10!) It looks like a return to the Lambda Complex might just be in order.<br /><br />That's when I found these:<br /><br /><object height="295" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/G32_q_3es8E&hl=en_GB&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/G32_q_3es8E&hl=en_GB&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object><br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/tOYxPgQThf4&hl=en_GB&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/tOYxPgQThf4&hl=en_GB&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">HOLY COW!</span><br /><br /><i>WHAT IS BLACK MESA?<br />Black Mesa is a complete re-creation of the game Half-Life, utilizing the </i>[more up to date Half-Life 2] <i>Source engine. Black Mesa will let you re-visit the world that started the Half-Life continuum. </i><br /><br />Although the first trailer shows a release date of 2009, according to the official website <a href="http://www.blackmesasource.com/" target="_blank">www.blackmesasource.com</a> that is not going to happen.&nbsp; It'll be released "when it's done"<br /><br />I know what your asking - Why play a game that you've already completed?<br />Simple:<br /><ul><li>Nostalgia </li><li>There's no way I'll remember it all</li><li>I know it's going to be good - the original game was<br /></li></ul>All that and the price can't be beaten either! <br /><br />Bring it on... after ten years, I can wait just a bit longer...<br /><br />- Chris<div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
