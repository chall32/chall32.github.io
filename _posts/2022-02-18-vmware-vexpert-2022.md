Yup, that's right... Again for the third year running!

I've again been appraised, approved and selected to be a VMware vExpert for the third year running!

Reading through the [vExpert 2022 Award Announcement](https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2022/02/16/vexpert-2022-awards-announcement/){:target="_blank"}:

All of the new and returning vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others. Contributing is not always blogging or Twitter as there are many VMUG leaders, public speakers, book authors, script writers, VCDX, VMTN community moderators and internal champions among this group.

Check me out in the [vExpert Directory](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/5800){:target="_blank"}.
