Lets face facts. Some areas of the datacentre infrastructure and cloud computing space have been quite turbulent over the last 12 to 24 months. I asked Claude.ai to sum it up for us, the outcome of which you can see at the bottom of this post.

So, as someone who works in the datacentre infrastructure and cloud computing space, what can I - or you - *we* do to insulate ourselves from negatively impacting industry events that are beyond our control?

One way is to become skilled to expert level in multiple disciplines; that is being able to design, deliver, operate and speak with expertise on cloud computing infrastructure from **multiple cloud computing vendors**.

Once I - or you - have gained the required skills, how can we:
- Connect with other multicloud experts and peers?
- Stay ahead of current developments in the multicloud space? 
- Keep our skills relevant with further learning and certification?
- Promote our multicloud expertise to the wider industry?

## Introducing The Multicloud Experts Community
The primary purpose of the Multicloud Expert community is to connect multicloud specialists to share expertise, collaborate on solutions and help each other navigate the complexities of modern cloud environments. 

Through active knowledge sharing and collaboration with community peers and top industry professionals — including Nutanix CTOs, engineers and consultants — community members build a collective understanding of cloud technologies, best practices, and emerging trends. 

Finally, community members stay ahead in the rapidly evolving cloud landscape with access to cutting-edge resources and certifications, expanding their skills through hands-on labs, tutorials and real-world case studies.

#### As promised, Claude.ai's timeline:
> I'll provide a timeline of the Broadcom-VMware acquisition and its aftermath, focusing on the key events and impacts. Note that since my knowledge cutoff was in April 2024, I'll present what was known up to that point.
>
> 2022:
- May 26: Broadcom announces plans to acquire VMware for $61 billion
- November: Deal receives approval from VMware shareholders
> 
> 2023:
- August 22: China's regulatory review period extended
- October 30: European Commission approves the deal
- November 21: China approves the acquisition
- November 22: Broadcom completes the $69 billion acquisition of VMware
> 
> Post-Acquisition Impact (late 2023 - early 2024):
- December 2023: 
  - Broadcom immediately begins laying off VMware employees
  - Announces end of perpetual licensing model, forcing customers to subscription-based pricing
  - Discontinues VMware's partner program, creating uncertainty for ecosystem partners
  - Increases prices significantly for many VMware products and services
> 
- January-March 2024:
  - Many enterprise customers report difficulty reaching support
  - Multiple VMware executive departures
  - Customer complaints about increased costs and reduced support quality
  - Reports of significant workforce reductions (estimated 20-30% of VMware staff)
  - Some customers begin exploring alternative virtualization solutions due to pricing changes
> 
> Key Negative Outcomes:
1. Employment Impact: Large-scale layoffs affecting thousands of VMware employees
2. Customer Relations: Deterioration in customer support and satisfaction
3. Cost Increases: Significant price hikes for existing customers
4. Business Model Changes: Forced transition to subscription-based pricing
5. Partner Ecosystem Disruption: Dismantling of established partner programs
6. Product Strategy: Uncertainty about future development of various VMware products
> 
> For the most current information about ongoing developments and impacts, I'd recommend consulting recent business news sources, as there may have been significant developments after my last update.
