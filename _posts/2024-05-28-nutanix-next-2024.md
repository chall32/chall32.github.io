Last week I had the opportunity to attend Nutanix's yearly conference known as .next. Think VMworld, but way, way, cooler :wink: 

This year's .next was held 21 - 23 May in sunny Barcelona, Spain and as mentioned I was one of the lucky ones to be able to attend.

This year, I was attending as a member of a team who's remit was and is to raise the profile of Nutanix and it's products throughout the virtualisation community and bloggersphere. To this end we invited 90+ virtualisation experts and bloggers to attend .next with us.

On the agenda alongside the many, many, many, general sessions and keynotes, we organised and provided some special virtualisation expert events. These included:

- On site training and examination to obtain Nutanix [NCA](https://www.credly.com/badges/85bf2e8a-8421-4fa9-b059-65f656d804e1/public_url){:target="_blank"} and [NCP-MCI](https://www.credly.com/badges/07191f0f-0729-4917-8973-47a44e44dcf5/public_url){:target="_blank"} qualifications amongst others
- Session with Nutanix Chief Technology Officer [Manosiz Bhattacharyya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manosiz-bhattacharyya-12189a/){:target="_blank"}
- Session with Nutanix Engineering Directors and VPs [Pranav Yogesh Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranavyogeshgupta/){:target="_blank"}, [Deepak Goel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakgoel9/){:target="_blank"} and [Yuvaraj Loganathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvarajl/){:target="_blank"}
- Session with [Patrick Koehler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-koehler/){:target="_blank"}, [Michael Goin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-goin/){:target="_blank"}, [Jesse Vega](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessedvega/){:target="_blank"}, and [Myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hall-63163197/){:target="_blank"}
- Evening beach bar reception with the virtualisation expert team, plus senior representatives from Nutanix leadership, sales and engineering teams
 
If you were lucky enough to attend, as I think you'll agree - an excellent time was had by all. Thank you!
