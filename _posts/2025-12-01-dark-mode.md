Hey there, PolarClouds reader! I've got some awesome news to share with you - your favourite website is now offering dark mode!

We know how important it is to take care of your eyes and reduce screen time (hello, digital well-being), so I've been working hard behind the scenes to bring this feature to life. Who doesn't love a good excuse to conserve battery life? By switching to dark mode, you'll not only be reducing eye strain but also giving your devices a little TLC. Just use the toggle in the top right hand corner of each page to try it out for yourself! 

At just over ten (**TEN!!!!**) years since launching PolarClouds [Hello and Welcome - Published November 12 2015](/hello-and-welcome/){:target="_blank"}, it was probably time!

Seventeen years and 2 months since the very first post on What The.....? - the site that eventually became PolarClouds! [Hello - published April 05 2008](/hello/hello/){:target="_blank"}. But who's counting?

I'll be there to cut the cake in a minute gang!
