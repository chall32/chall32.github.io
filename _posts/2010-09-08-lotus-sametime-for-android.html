Typical applications include games running on mobile devices and cell phones which have small graphical displays, simple numeric keypad interfaces and limited network access over HTTP. </i>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDlet">Wikipedia</a>]<br /><br />Right oh... Sounds complicated.&nbsp; Trust me. It really isn't complicated at all. &nbsp; <br /><br />Unknown to many, IBM/Lotus already produce a Sametime MIDlet, and they ship it with their Lotus Sametime Server software.&nbsp; These MIDlets are primarilly aimed at Nokia 'E' series (Symbian based) handsets.<br /><br />All we need to do is package that Lotus created MIDlet into a format that Android understands (i.e. an Android .apk package file), and install it along with a free J2ME environment to launch the MIDlet in.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/TIf7A2Jw1yI/AAAAAAAAApk/ANTsWLcASyE/s1600/SameTime.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img title="Lotus Sametime Running on Android!" alt="Lotus Sametime Running on Android!" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/TIf7A2Jw1yI/AAAAAAAAApk/ANTsWLcASyE/s320/SameTime.png" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roll Your Own Client</b></span><br />Here is how you can quickly and very easily make your own Android Lotus Sametime client.<br /><br />Files Required:<br /><ul><li>sametime.jad [Java Description file]</li><li>sametime.jar [The J2ME Java applet itself]</li></ul>The first step is to talk nicely to your Sametime server administrator and try to obtain these using this route.&nbsp; These two files are shipped with the Lotus Sametime server software.<br /><br />Alternatively, you <i>could</i> download the Sametime v8.5.1 files from <a href="http://im.bleedyellow.com/sametime/mobile/clients/Nokia/en/Sametime.jad">jad here</a> and <a href="http://im.bleedyellow.com/sametime/mobile/clients/Nokia/en/Sametime.jar">jar here</a><br />or<br />From the Sametime v8.0.1 zip posted <a href="http://www.noeman.org/gsm/symbian-os-9-1-applications/61972-lotus-sametime-mobile-connect-8-a.html" target="_blank">here</a><br />but that wouldn't sit well with your Lotus Licence agreement now would it...<br /><br />The next step is to convert these files into an Android application .apk file.&nbsp; <br /><br />Luckily for us, there is an online converter on the Netmite website <a href="http://www.netmite.com/android/srv/2.0/getapk.php" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;  Just upload the jad and jar files and click Get Apk.&nbsp; What could be simpler?<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Install and Run</b></span> <br />Once downloaded, install the apk onto your Android.&nbsp; I suggest you use the <a href="http://webtrickz.com/how-to-install-apk-files-on-android-phones-easy-way/" target="_blank">application installs using Astro</a> method if you don't know how to manually install an apk file.<br /><br />Upon launching the Sametime app for the first time you may be challenged with this dialogue:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/TIgMF9musEI/AAAAAAAAAps/VUt7HnnpyWQ/s1600/InstallJ2ME.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img title="Download J2ME" alt="Download J2mE" border="0" height="157" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2xKZgKYJlJs/TIgMF9musEI/AAAAAAAAAps/VUt7HnnpyWQ/s200/InstallJ2ME.png" width="200" /></a></div><br />Remember at the top of this post I mentioned that the Sametime app ran in a Java 2 Micro Environment?&nbsp; This is the prompt to download and install that environment.&nbsp; Select Get from Android Market and install.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Once the the J2ME environment is installed and the Sametime app launches OK, configure the client as you would any other Sametime client.&nbsp; Perhaps a good time to pop back to see the Samtime administrator again?<br /><br />Then start enjoying some mobile Sametime chat. &nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>J2ME Screen Size Tweak</b></span><br />One thing to bear in mind when tweaking:<br /><ul><li>Menus options <b>with</b> equals signs at each end make changes to the J2ME environment</li><li>Menus options <b>without</b> equals signs at each end make changes to the Sametime app itself</li></ul>These are suggested settings based on running Sametime in a J2ME on the Android emulator and on my <a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;id=2025&amp;c=t-mobile_pulse_huawei_u8220" target="_blank">T-Mobile Pulse / U8220</a>.&nbsp; Your mileage may vary depending onthe screen size and resolution of your Android device.<br /><br />Launch Sametime app / MIDlet<br />Menu ---&gt; =System Menu= ---&gt; =Settings= ---&gt;<br /><ul><li>Untick "Auto detect Game Canvas"</li><li>My Display Width = 320</li><li>My Display Height = 450</li><li>Orientation = Portrait</li></ul><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Bugs</span></b><br />This is by no means an exhaustive list, but these are the most major bugs picked up so far: <br /><ul><li>Some buttons (most noticeably the send button) need tapping twice to do anything.  This is also true for menu drop downs etc</li><li>Annoyingly changes to the sametime display settings (built into the ST app rather than the J2ME) won't / don't apply</li><li>Run as a service - it doesn't.  Looks to run OK in background, but some android task killers may kill it, or it may silently die for whatever reason [remember that this isn't a native android app, so I don't think we can do anything about this]</li><li>Chat Screen - the chat screen is too small.  I think this might be fixed if we can get the ST settings to apply (bullet 2 above) </li></ul><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Conclusion</b></span><br />Yes I know that this is a "kludge" and I whole heartedly  agree that there are issues with running Sametime this way (see the BUGS  section for details), but the fact of the matter is that a client  created using this method connects, runs and is quite usable.&nbsp; In fact, given the  alternatives (oh yea IBM where the hell is the native Andriod client you  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/19/lotus_notes_app_android/" target="_blank">promised over eight moths ago?</a>) this works, and works quite well all things considered.<br /><br />- Chris<div class="blogger-post-footer"><p>
